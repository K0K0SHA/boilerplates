C BOILERPLATES BY K0K0$h@

ABSTRACT
This repo is designed not for functional code, but as a reference for how to use C and C++. 

PLATFORMS
LINUX & MAC: This code is designed for Linux, and tested on Linux. It should also run the exact same on Mac. 
WINDOWS: It's possible to run this code on Windows if gcc/g++ is installed, however you may run into trouble with filepaths using backslashes \ on Windows. Thus, I recommend to use Powershell. This code is not guaranteed or intended to run on Windows.
