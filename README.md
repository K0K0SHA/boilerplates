# boilerplates

Miscellaneous boilerplate code, for practical programming *and hacking* made easier.

# what's in this repository
I created a custom library in Python named miscX. This library has many useful features. It makes programming and administration an easy breeze, if used correctly. This library is required for nearly all other code on each repo from the K0K0$HA GitHub. This repository is designed to be built atop of. 

TODO
1. Dependency check with Python
2. Root check with Python
3. Terminal command with Java, C, and Python
