# boilerplates

Miscellaneous boilerplate code, for practical programming made easier.

Feel free to reproduce this code, modify it, etc.

# what's in this repository
I tried my best to make these boilerplates functional, stable, and efficient.
I am only a one-man programming team, so you or your org may have better ways.
These boilerplates are what all my code is based on, assembled piece by piece. 
When another one of my repos is used, it will clone at least part of this repo.

TODO
