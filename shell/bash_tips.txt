Use && to execute several commands, one after the other eg.
ifconfig && ./myscript.sh

Use > to overwrite file with a command's output eg.
cat > myfile.txt

Use | (pipe) to take command output and put into another command's input eg.
ifconfig | cat > ifconfig.txt 

use chmod +x <path_to_file> to make a file executable, eg
$chmod +x ./myscript.sh && ./myscript.sh
copying preserves permissions...
